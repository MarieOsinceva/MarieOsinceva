<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋 </h1>
<h3 align="center">Frontend developer on React Native</h3>

Currently I am in Russia. But soon I am moving to Slovenia 🇸🇮 <br />
Most of my career I worked for start-ups. So I had to learn a lot on my own.<br />
My hobbies are drawing, yoga/stretching and drinking coffee in cafe. Also I like traveling so I would not mind moving to another country.<br />
